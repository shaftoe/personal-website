## This website uses a self hosted instance of Ackee for web analytics

[Ackee](https://ackee.electerious.com/) is an Open Source software replacement for tools like _Google Analytics_ which is more respectful of the user privacy and _tries its best to keep tracked data anonymized_ as stated in the [official documentation](https://docs.ackee.electerious.com/#/docs/Anonymization). This website is configured with disabled `detailed` option for Ackee which reduces the amount of data collected to the bare minimum and still provides some valuable insight about how this website is used.
