<p><span class="h-card"><a href="https://cmpwn.com/@sir" class="u-url mention">@<span>sir</span></a></span> I strongly vouch for ProtonMail: I&apos;m a free-tier user since ages and can&apos;t be any happier.</p><p>It&apos;s a rock solid service, both iOS and web apps are quite good and free tier storage is more than enough for my needs.</p><p>I recommend using email as a communication tool only (i.e. not as data storage), regardless of the service provider.</p><p>Also, I don&apos;t get the &quot;open standard must be free&quot; argument. Do you expect SMTP providers like Mailjet to give it away for free?</p>
