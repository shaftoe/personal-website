<p>This morning I woke up before dawn and went for a walk; the clouds, the post-apocalyptic lights and the absence of human life put me in the right mood to work on a &quot;video clip&quot; idea I had.</p><p>I borrowed Territory by The Blaze, which I think is the perfect soundtrack to tell a short story.</p><p>I love this song and I had a story to tell, so here we go, this is my personal interpretation of the meaning of &quot;territory&quot;.</p><p>It also means you&apos;re going to meet my local friends.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/CuEHEPax_dY" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="">youtu.be/CuEHEPax_dY</span><span class="invisible"></span></a></p>
