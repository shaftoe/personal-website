<p>Finally started to work on the new version of my personal blog/main website.</p><p>Stack:<br />- Hugo static site generator<br />- HTML5/CSS3 for markup and layout<br />- Markdown for all the content<br />- vanilla JS for some prebuild API interaction and responsive layout handling<br />- Netlify for hosting + CI/CD + CDN</p><p>So far so (very) good. <a href="https://fosstodon.org/tags/hugo" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>hugo</span></a>  is really powerful, learning curve is a bit steep (and Go templates syntax is ackward) but it really helps a lot in keeping the codebase DRY.</p>
